In this repository, I'm following [Learn Rust by example](https://rustbyexample.com) and implementing what I learn as tests (koans-style). Feel free to fork for your own learning.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thbar/rust-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thbar/rust-playground)

### Steps to use

* Install Rust ([rustup](https://www.rustup.rs) is the recommended way)
* Open [Rust by example](https://rustbyexample.com)
* Run with `cargo test`
* Run on file change with `find src | entr -c cargo test`
